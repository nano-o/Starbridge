# Starbridge Docs

The docs in this directory describe a Stellar to Ethereum bridge. The docs are high-level and rather lightweight at this time.

- [Requirements](requirements.md)
- [Design](design.md)
- [Protocol](protocol.md)
- [Formal model](formal-model/starbridge.ivy)

All diagrams are drawn using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) and have the scene embedded and can be edited.
